## Running the tests

We use [pytest][pytest: Getting Started Guide] as our website test runner.
You will need to install `pytest` on your development machine.

```bash
pip3 install pytest
```

### Running Tests


Run the `pytest` command in your terminal, 
Linux/MacOS
```bash
$ python3 -m pytest roman_numerals_test.py
==================== 7 passed in 0.08s ====================
```

Windows
```powershell
PS C:\Users\foobar> py -m pytest  roman_numerals_test.py
